1.fix box cover, it was a problem with the original program as well
    - the problem is still there, but it's barely noticeable
2.add a title screen, maybe with a different song
3.fix sound fade in
    - i reduced the volume altogether, it's not a big issue anymore
4.game still freezing when restarting
5.add icon file from the auto-py-2-exe thing
6.maybe add increased difficulty as the levels progress
