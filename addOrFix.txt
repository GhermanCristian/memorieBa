1.fix box cover, it was a problem with the original program as well
    - the problem is still there, but it's barely noticeable
2.add a title screen, maybe with a different song
3.fix sound fade in
    - i reduced the volume altogether, it's not a big issue anymore
4.game still freezing when restarting
	- since i've started using levels i haven't noticed this issue
5.more sound cues
	- guta "pula mea"
	- www sexy bomba com
	- miroase a ambreiaj
6.maybe add increased difficulty as the levels progress
