1.fix box cover, it was a problem with the original program as well
    - the problem is still there, but it's barely noticeable
2.add a title screen, maybe with a different song
3.fix sound fade in
    - i reduced the volume altogether, it's not a big issue anymore
4.game still freezing when restarting
    - since adding levels, i haven't noticed this issue
6.maybe add increased difficulty as the levels progress
7.add sound cues:
    - guta "pula mea"
    - miroase a ambreiaj
    - www sexy bomba com
    * maybe censor ilie dumitrescu ? or add a censored version of the game
9.change the soundtrack / add more
