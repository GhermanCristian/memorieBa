    - the problem is still there, but it's barely noticeable
2.add something to the title screen
3.fix sound fade in
    - i reduced the volume altogether, it's not a big issue anymore
4.game still freezing when restarting
6.maybe add increased difficulty as the levels progress
7.sound cues:
	- mircea badea mi le bag in ...
    * miroase a ambreiaj - tried it but it doesn't sound right, it's still in the game files if i need it
    * maybe censor ilie dumitrescu ? or add a censored version of the game

	- 
10.fix issue with exiting from the welcome screen and fadeOut (maybe using the volume ?)
