1.fix box cover, it was a problem with the original program as well
    - the problem is still there, but it's barely noticeable
2.add a title screen, maybe with a different song
3.fix sound fade in
    - i reduced the volume altogether, it's not a big issue anymore
4.more sound cues, maybe put them in a list or sth ?
