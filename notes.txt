1. after the welcome screen transition, a part of the "image" remains on the screen
2. ensure nrBoxes is divisible with nr_revealed_boxes
3. in displayBoxCoverage, don't calculate the position of the box each time, but rather do it when shuffling the list
4. when covering/ revealing a box, the space is not completely covered bc BOX_SIZE is not divisible by REVEAL_SPEED 
5. imageRepo object is used twice (once in board, then in GUI)
6. resize the title screen image
